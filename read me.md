# Playing around with different components for PC tech

I want to build a CRUD SPA

ToDo: Make sure I put everthing on GitHub

Initial focus will be user login to add their details and view their trip

1. Need to figure out how to build a login page
2. Need to figure out how to store information in a database
     - combine the other database app that was build with this project

Node JS for an API to a MongoDB database

# Some useful points

The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#").

# Issues

My commits don't seem to be getting sent to GitHub
