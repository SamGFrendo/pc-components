# Playing around with different components for PC tech

I want to build a CRUD SPA

ToDo: Make sure I put everthing on GitHub - not just this file

Initial focus will be user login to add their details and view their trip

Building a login page would be good - first I can just figure out some components
- first - switch between user form and user view
- Use local storage then move to use API and database
- link through to willy's mvp 

1. Need to figure out how to build a login page
2. Need to figure out how to store information in a database
     - combine the other database app that was build with this project

I'VE FIGURED OUT WHAT I CAN DO WITH JQUERY NOW!!!

Node JS for an API to a MongoDB database

# Some useful points

ID identifies one element - class can be used to identify more than one

select class with a full stop (“.”)select id with a hash character (“#")

the jQuery form validator plugin heavily uses classes to define the validation behavior of elements (e.g. required or not, or defining the type of input format) - HAVE A LOOK INTO THIS!! 


# Issues

node-rest-api not working (even though they working where the files were)

# Information about the form element 
The 'action' attribute specifies the URI/URL of the page that will process the form

The 'enctype' attribute specifies the content type used to encode the form data set when it's submitted to the server. It is not necessary in my initial use case

The 'method' Specifies the HTTP method to use when the form is submitted. Possible values: get (The form data is appended to the URL when submitted. This is the default value.) post (The form data is not appended to the URL.)
